 ## Gut Buster
We aim to provide healthy food options, meal plans, workout plans, and also deliver a live chat feature accessible from the browser. This web app provides a secure Google login that allows users to identify themselves, a custom statistical profile for body macros, workouts, and a food search tool that shows a meal, its calorie count, preparation time and a link to the recepie. This app also features a live chat platform through which users can communicate with each other.
